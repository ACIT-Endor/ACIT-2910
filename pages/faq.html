            <div id="faqTitle">Have a question?</div>
            <div class="faqQuestion"> When was Endor Eats Founded?
                <div class="faqAnswer"> Endor Eats was founded in a crowded room of a building in a galaxy not so far away. Our passion for food lead us on a path to create Endor Eats so that we could share our suffering and tears to the rest of the galaxy.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faqQuestion"> What are your hours of operation?
                <div class="faqAnswer"> We work when we want to, nobody tells us what to do. We're open when we're open, deal with it.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faqQuestion"> Why are some of your staff proffesional looking, and some are just a bowl of ice-cream?
                <div class="faqAnswer"> We are proud of our cultural and race diversity. We hire anyone of any race regardless of there appearance. So you should be ashamed for thinking a bowl of ice-cream is any less capable than Mr.Bejaman.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faqQuestion"> What should I order?
                <div class="faqAnswer"> Everything tastes amazing!! (Subjectively speaking), if you don't like anything thats your fault. Go get your tastebuds re-trained. Also try to order only one thing, we only have one chef in-house at all times.</div>
